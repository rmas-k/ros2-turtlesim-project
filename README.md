# 🐢 ROS2 Turtlesim Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates basic manipulation using the turtlesim package in ROS2 (Humble).  
We use two terminals to:

- 🖥️ Launch the turtlesim node (GUI window with a turtle)  
- ⌨️ Control the turtle using keyboard keys

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Launch turtlesim node  
Open the first terminal and run:source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

### 2. Control the turtle  
Open a second terminal and run:source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

Use arrow keys to move the turtle.  
Press Q to quit.
